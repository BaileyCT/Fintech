# Fintech Case Study
## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
<br>
Ripple Labs
<br>

### When was the company incorporated?
<br>

Ripple was founded in 2012
<br>

### Who are the founders of the company?
<br>

Ripple Labs was founded by Chris Larsen and Jeb McCaleb. The idea of the p]Ripple is to modernize the institutional payments industry by "unlocking the power of blockchain" (Ripple.com, 2021). The company was funded through venture capitist investment. They have received over 293.8 million dollars (Crunchbase, 2021).
<br>

## Business Activities:
<br>

Founded in 2012 with the introduction of Blockchain technology, Ripple Lab's aim is to tackle the institutional payments industry and replace older technologies such as swift with a faster, decentrilized network. this network called RippleX or "XRP" is a cryptocurrency/blockchain network that offers developers and others to ability build faster and cheaper applications that focus on B2B global payments. The main focus for B2B payments is cost, speed and security. 
<br>

Ripple Lab's main customer base is financial institutions, examples of these in Canada would be Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, TD Bank, and Royal Bank of Canada. It is estimated that roughly $120 trillion per year globally with $25 trillion per year domestically (Goldenberg, 2020) is exchanged in B2B payments. This generates a market size of approximatly US $732.4 billion in 2019 (PMI, 2019) with an expect compounding annual growth of 10.1%. because these metrics are pre pandemic it is beleived that this value is closer to a trillion dollar industry. Currently there is one company that has majority control of this industry. Glodenberg notes that this a underpentrated market, with accelerating digital adoption this market is ripe for exponetial growth(Goldenberg, 2020).

<br>

Ripple core competency is Blockchain technology. They specifically implemented the Ripple Potocal Concensus Algorithm (RPCA) which is the main authenticator for the Ripple network. They deployed Two main applications to this network. Xrapid, a global payments application that leverages XRP as a bridge between two accounts.  the premise of Xrapid or on demand liquidity is the elimination of pre-funding destination accounts allowing banks to utilize more of their capital. The second application is Xcurrent which is an enterprise solution for fulfilling instant settlements and tracking. Xcurrent is built on a different protocal from the other applications. This technology is Interledger Protocol. Xcurrent is made up of four functionalities Messaging, Validation, Interledger Protocol, and Fx rates. These functionalities allow members to exchange information and details about transactions to each other, utilize a network of their own or third party validators to confrim the success or failure of a transaction, store and update a decentrelized ledge containg the debts, credits and liquity of each member, and understand the rates for exchanging currencies. Along with these technologies Ripple Lab's also utilizes a diverse collection of Devops, data and business tools to manage their service. I have added images from Stackshare to highlight them.

## Landscape:

As mentioned earlier Ripple Lab's is located in the B2B payments industry. They have one main competitor, Swift. Swift operates the Global Payments Innovation or gpi which is the most widely adopted digital global payments solution in this industy. They have been the key competitor driving innovation and adoption in this space but Ripple is quickly gaining ground (Faden, 2020). The largest difference between Swift and Ripple is the use of blockchain technology, Swift utilizes their proprietary Swift codes and messaging network to help parties exchange destination and information using a universial code to identify an individual branch. 

<br> 

With in the next five to ten years we will see blockchain technology dominate this space. Blockchain offers a extremly cost effective solution while allowing parties to utilize more of thier capital and reduce the lag and cost curently associated with sending payments and money. This can accelorate the number of transactions and payments that credit card companies can handle and is a reason why American express is utilizing their service. A very new trend for the payments industry highlighted by Tesla founder Elon Musk will be utilizing efficent technolgies to process payments. the move towards cryptocurrency is in no doubt coming, but focusing on technologies that do not require mass amounts of energy to process and maintain will be a key for companies such as Ripple moving forward.

<br>

## Results
<br>

Currently Ripple has gotten over 300 institutions added to the ripple network(Ripple.com, 2021). This pales in comparison to the around 11,000 institutions that are utilizng Swift (swift.com, 2021). While this number is stagering there is still considerable number of users making their way to blockchain and it is beiginning to reach the early majority stage of the adoption cycle. there isnt much information on the amount of money they have moved on their network but the value of Ripple has now worth over US $ 10 billion (Browne, 2019)

<br>


## Recommendations


A recomendation I have for Ripple is to include a more individual application on the Ripple network, similar to Venmo in the US and Wealthsimple Cash in Canada an Individual application would also allow Ripple to capture more of the market and be able to compete with other Fintech companies in this space. I beleive this service would be extremely benifical to Ripple as it would provide additional revenue sources and unlock the use of more payments, they could utilize this service closer to Wepay in China where by users are able to make payments at merchants around the world with out the use of a credit or debit card. Ripple has already gotten intrest from some credit card companies and could utilize them to handle payments directly from a customers device using NFC. I beleive these technologies are appropriate for this solution as it provides users an additional way to make payments either P2P or C2B, for Ripple it would mean gaining Thousands to millions more to their network for validation of the ledger as well as millions in additional revenue.
